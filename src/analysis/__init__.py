"""
This package contains all the code definitions we used in the analysis but that we
didn't implement directly within the notebook (inline). The thinking here is that we
don't want to cloud or bloat the notebook with code that doesn't significantly
contribute to reader understanding. Of course, this code is still critical for
reproducibilty, and so the documentation for this code is included herein, and the
source code can be read directly by clicking the "[source]" button associated with each
object.
