"""
This package contains all the code we used in the analysis that we didn't include inline
within the notebook. The thinking here is that we don't want to cloud or bloat the
notebook with code that doesn't significantly contribute to reader understanding. Of
course, this code is still critical for reproducibilty, and so the documentation for
this code is included herein, and the source code can be read directly by clicking the
"[source]" button associated with each object.
