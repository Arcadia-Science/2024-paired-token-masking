# Welcome

This publication is an experiment aimed to reduce publication burden at Arcadia Science by strongly coupling our exploratory analyses with our publishable results. Essentially, we're experimenting with getting out small, digestable publications that are informal, approachable, exploratory, and that intertwine code and figures with prose. We're entertaining this idea because within our teams, we often internally share results in the form of Jupyter notebooks and our thought is that with just a little more lift, these could be publishable externally.

We're hopeful this approach closes two key gaps:

1. It addresses the common disconnect between publications and their underlying code/data. Since what you're reading is rendered directly from {{ '[this codebase]({})'.format(repo_link) }}, reproducibility is an inherent feature of this publication.

2. It aims to reduce the delay between conducting our research and receiving community feedback, which we believe is a more efficient way to advance scientific discourse.

With that in mind, you can consider this our first experiment in this domain. If you have feedback or things you liked or didn't like, please share your opinions.
