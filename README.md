## Purpose & Description

TODO: Briefly describe the core analyses performed in the repository and the motivation behind them.

## Installation and Setup

This repository uses conda to manage software environments and installations. You can find operating system-specific instructions for installing miniconda [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/). After installing conda and [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), run the following command to create the environment.

```{bash}
mamba env create -n esm-paired-masked-tokens --file env.yml
conda activate esm-paired-masked-tokens
pip install -e .
```

1. Install your pre-commit hooks:

    ```{bash}
    pre-commit install
    ```

    This installs the pre-commit hooks defined in your config (`./.pre-commit-config.yaml`).

2. Export your conda environment before sharing:

    As your project develops, the number of dependencies in your environment may increase. Whenever you install new dependencies (using either `pip install` or `mamba install`), you should update the environment file using the following command.

    ```{bash}
    conda env export --from-history --no-builds > envs/dev.yml
    ```

    `--from-history` only exports packages that were explicitly added by you (e.g., the packages you installed with `pip` or `mamba`) and `--no-builds` removes build specification from the exported packages to increase portability between different platforms.
